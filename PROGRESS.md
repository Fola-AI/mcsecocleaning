# PROGRESS.md — mcsecocleaning build log

> **For Fola:** this is the one file to check. The top section shows where things stand and whether anything needs you. **For Claude Code:** this is the only status file you write. Update it after every completed item.

## Status

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Current stage** | L1 — Reconcile and guardrails |
| **Next action** | Run the session-start checks, create `build/autonomous` from `fix/pre-phase3-gate`, then work the L1 checklist (PRD §16.3). The *Baseline* below is verified — confirm it still holds, don't re-derive it |
| **Working branch** | `build/autonomous` (not yet created). Currently on `fix/pre-phase3-gate`, head `2cfdf3d`, **unpushed** — 6 commits ahead of `main` |
| **Last updated** | 8 Oct 2026 — reconciliation pass by Claude (chat): docs restructured, baseline re-verified against the working branch with the full gate run |
| **Needs Fola?** | **Yes, before L2 can start:** `.env.local` does not exist (Q-6). D1 and D2 were answered on 8 Oct — Q-7 closed, Q-2 answered. 5 of the 6 *Open questions* below are still live. *Review queue* is empty |

## Baseline — verified against `fix/pre-phase3-gate` (head `2cfdf3d`), 8 Oct 2026

Earlier figures in this file came from a 30 Sep snapshot of `main` and were wrong for the working branch. These are measured.

| | `main` | `fix/pre-phase3-gate` (working branch) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript files in `src/` | 119 | **126** (~12,600 lines) |
| Test files | 14 | **18** |
| Unit tests passing | — | **127** |
| Prisma models / enums | 36 / 20 | **36 / 20** (unchanged) |
| Manual migrations | 6 | **9** |

The branch is 6 commits ahead of `main` and has **never been pushed** — it exists only on this Mac. Nothing in it is on GitHub.

### Verify gate — all green on the working branch

```
$ npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
(no output — clean)

$ npm run lint          # eslint
(no output — clean)

$ npm test              # node --import tsx --test "src/**/*.test.ts"
ℹ tests 127
ℹ pass 127
ℹ fail 0
ℹ duration_ms 510.212291

$ npm run build         # prisma generate + check-price-parity + next build
✓ built — 38 routes prerendered/served
  ○ static · ● SSG · ƒ dynamic; middleware active
```

The drift check (`prisma migrate diff`) has **not** been run — there is no database to run it against. That is L2's first job.

### Phase 1 — marketing site: built
- Next.js 16.3.4 / React 19.2.8 / Tailwind v4, Vercel `lhr1`, served on `*.vercel.app`.
- `noindex` enforced by the build guard (`src/lib/seo/indexing-guard.ts`, called from `next.config.ts`): a production build on a real custom domain throws unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING="true"`.
- Routes: home, six service hubs `/[service]`, gated location pages `/[service]/[area]`, prices, about, contact, guarantee, areas-we-cover, reviews, eco-cleaning, blog (3 articles), legal (privacy, cookies, terms, cancellation-policy).
- SEO: JSON-LD (no `AggregateRating`), sitemap, robots, `llms.txt`, OG image.
- GA4 behind consent (`ConsentAnalytics`).
- Lead capture covers RFQ, waitlist and `domestic_sales` escalation.
- Areas are the §4 cluster with `patchGroup`: Kennington, Elephant & Castle, Brixton, Battersea, Wandsworth, Peckham, Clapham (core) and Bromley.
- Inngest crons (`src/lib/inngest/`): heartbeat, subscription materialisation, verification-token sweep, deposit nudge.
- **Not done:** real company details — 26 `PLACEHOLDER` values in `src/config/site.ts`. Also Search Console, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, Sentry, uptime monitoring, real photography.

### Phase 2 — booking and payments: built, never run against a real DB or Stripe
- **Pricing:** rate card `src/lib/pricing/rate-card.ts` (EOT grid by flat/house × beds × baths; hourly services; add-ons); quote engine `src/lib/quote.ts` (EOT instant-priced, escalation only at 5+ bedrooms or heavily soiled); `fromPriceFor` derives the true floor; parity check runs inside `npm run build`.
- **Booking:** capacity `src/lib/capacity.ts` reads the **placeholder roster in `src/config/availability.ts`**, not the database; 8-step wizard on real slots with versioned CCR consent; pre-contract email; recurrence `src/lib/recurrence.ts` tested across BST/GMT and bank holidays; discount codes and CSV import.
- **Payments** (`src/lib/payments.ts`, `src/lib/stripe.ts`, `src/lib/webhook-reconcile.ts`, `src/app/actions/payments.ts`): authorise at booking; 25% deposit when gross > £250 or > 300 minutes (`src/config/payments.ts`); `markJobComplete`, `retryCapture`, `cancelAndRefundBooking`, `rechargeOutstanding`; webhook at `/api/stripe/webhook` with `WebhookEvent` idempotency.
- **Admin:** `/admin` counts dashboard only; `/admin/jobs` (complete/capture), `/admin/leads` (convert), `/admin/bookings/new`, `/admin/import`. Access via Auth.js `requireRole`; `src/middleware.ts` is a coarse cookie-presence check only, by design.
- **Customer:** `/account` with pay-outstanding, pause/resume/cancel, marketing preference, property edit (write-only encrypted access codes).
- Owner seeded as `mcsecocleaning@gmail.com`.

### Pre-Phase-3 gate — on the working branch, not on `main`
Six commits: Stripe fixes for flags 1, 2, 3 and 6 plus the flag 4/5 decisions; `b7fb131` explicit "no payment link was created" (`src/lib/admin-booking.ts`); `2cfdf3d` docs. Migrations #7–#9 (`2026-09-30-*`). **Neon:** Fola created the project (London), a `gate` branch and a `psql` connection (PG 18.6), and was setting Vercel env vars. Nothing after that is recorded, and none of it is reachable from this machine — see Q-6.

---

## Environment readiness — **not ready for L2**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `.env.local` | **Absent.** The ignition prompt assumes it exists and is filled |
| `.env` | Present, git-ignored, **stale**: it is `.env.example` with `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` left at `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/...`. `hasDatabase` correctly reads that as "no database", so the app runs DB-less. No real credential is in it and nothing sensitive is committed — `.gitignore` covers `.env*` and only `.env.example` is tracked |
| Neon `dev` branch | Not reachable — no connection string on this machine. `DEV_DB_HOST` unset, so the L1 `assert-dev-db` guard has nothing to compare against |
| Stripe | No key present, test or live |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Created 8 Oct 2026 from `SETUP.md` §5 so the build can run unattended. L1 validates it |

**Consequence for the autonomous run:** L1 needs no keys and can run now. L2 is blocked until `SETUP.md` §3 is done. Stages L3–L13 all depend on L2, so a build started today completes L1 and then stops. Filling `.env.local` is the single highest-value thing Fola can do.

### Keys present (names only, updated each session)

| Stage | Needs | Present? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | none | ✅ n/a |
| L2 | `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `DEV_DB_HOST`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `ACCESS_CODE_ENC_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `DEV_EMAIL_REDIRECT` | ❌ none |
| L7 | `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET`, `MEDIA_LINK_SECRET` | ❌ none |
| L9 | `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_SENDER_ID` | ❌ none |
| L11 | Stripe Bacs enabled (test), `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALCOM_URL` | ❌ none |
| L12 | `GOOGLE_REVIEW_URL` | ❌ none |
| L14 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`; Upstash optional | ❌ none |

## Gaps found, assigned to stages

Re-measured on 8 Oct 2026. Three entries that the earlier snapshot got wrong are marked **corrected**.

- **L1 — trust claims nobody has confirmed, hardcoded in six files.** "£5m public liability", "DBS-checked" and "Fully insured" appear in `src/app/page.tsx` (trust badges, how-it-works step, FAQ answer), `src/app/about/page.tsx`, `src/components/ui/TrustBar.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`, `src/config/services.ts` and `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx`. Only `publicLiabilityCover` reads config (`src/config/site.ts`), and that value is a `PLACEHOLDER`. Routing them through config is a prerequisite to gating them.
- **L1 — stale config.** `.env.example` still lists the retired `ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE` (no code reads it since Auth.js) and lacks `APP_ENV`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `DEV_DB_HOST`, `DEV_EMAIL_REDIRECT`, `DEV_SMS_REDIRECT`, `MEDIA_LINK_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING`. (`README.md` was corrected on 8 Oct — status line and the links to the archived PRD and `BUILD-STATUS.md`.)
- **L1 — business-input markers**: 26 `PLACEHOLDER`, 2 `TODO(business-input)`, 2 `TODO(ops)`, 0 `TODO(pricing)`, 0 `TODO(legal)`, across `src/config/site.ts`, `src/config/availability.ts`, `src/lib/capacity.ts`, `src/lib/pricing/rate-card.ts`, `src/app/cancellation-policy/page.tsx`. `npm run check:launch-inputs` (L1) must find these five files.
- **L4 — capacity is config-backed, but the engine is ready.** **Corrected:** `src/lib/capacity.ts` is already a pure function taking `crews: CrewAvailability[]` and `existingJobs: ExistingJob[]`. L4 is a loader, not a rewrite.
- **L4 — `JobAssignment`** has `isLead`/`assignedAt` only; no `offeredAt`/`acceptedAt`/`declinedAt`.
- **L4 — `CrewProfile`.** **Corrected:** it *does* have `dbsCheckedAt`. Missing are `dbsExpiresAt` and `insuranceExpiresAt`.
- **L6 — access codes are further along than the stage title suggests.** **Corrected:** AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt, the reveal window and `canRevealAccessCode` are built and tested in `src/lib/access-codes.ts`; `Property.accessCodeEncrypted`/`alarmCodeEncrypted` and `AccessCodeAudit` are in the schema. What is missing is the crew reveal surface and **refusal logging** — `recordAccessCodeView` writes only on success, so `AccessCodeAudit` cannot distinguish a reveal from a refusal. Needs an `outcome` field.
- **L12** — schema has no `Review.wasIncentivised`/`incentiveDisclosed`, no `Job.isPromotional`, no `Quote.abandonedAt`/`recoveryEmailSentAt`.
- **Post-launch** — schema still uses `AIInsight`, not `AgentAction` (PRD §16.4).

### Deferred items carried forward
- Payment-link copy/reissue on `/admin/jobs` → **L2**.
- Cross-session payment resume page → deferred (the deposit nudge covers it).
- GDPR erasure as anonymise/soft-delete → **L13**.
- Rate-card editor (Task 5) → **L10**, subject to SETUP D3.

## Open questions for Fola

Format: **Q-n** · stage · question · options (none picked) · what's blocked.

- **Q-6** · L2 and everything after · **`.env.local` does not exist on this machine.** `SETUP.md` §3 has not been completed here, so there is no Neon `dev` connection string, no `DEV_DB_HOST`, no Stripe test key, no `AUTH_SECRET`. Options: complete `SETUP.md` §3 now / let the build run L1 only and stop. **Blocks: L2 and, transitively, L3–L15.** Nothing else Fola can do matters as much as this one.
- **Q-1** · all · Eco positioning weight (PRD §16.7 #1, SETUP D6). Options: primary from day one / phase-two differentiator. Blocks: nothing in code; affects copy emphasis.
- **Q-2** · L4 · ~~Employee or self-employed crews (SETUP D2).~~ **Answered 8 Oct 2026: not decided — build both.** L4 builds and tests `assign` and `offer`; the production config value is chosen before launch. The underlying employment-status question (PRD §14.6, §16.7 #2) still affects the cost floor and so Q-4.
- **Q-3** · L1 · Trust facts: are crews DBS-checked, and what public liability cover is actually held, with which insurer? Until confirmed, L1 hides both claims across all seven files. Blocks: nothing; the claims simply stay hidden. Note the site currently asserts both to the public.
- **Q-4** · launch · Cost-per-crew-hour model (§16.7 #8) may change rate-card figures. Blocks: launch pricing sign-off only.
- **Q-5** · launch · Company facts for `src/config/site.ts` (SETUP §6) — 26 placeholders. Blocks: the L15 release gate (`npm run check:launch-inputs`).

## Decisions made (by Claude Code)

Format: **D-n** · stage · decision · why · alternative · how to reverse.

**SETUP §1 answers on record (8 Oct 2026):** D1 = **A**, batch review at the five merge checkpoints — schema, pricing-logic, payment and auth changes are built, tested, committed and listed under *Review queue*; they do **not** halt the build. D2 = **not decided**, build both assignment modes. D3–D6 remain blank and are parked per `CLAUDE.md` → *Park it and keep going*.

Decisions taken during the 8 Oct reconciliation, before the autonomous run:

- **D-0a** · pre-L1 · The five build documents (`CLAUDE.md`, `PRD.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `SETUP.md`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md`) live at the **repo root**, not `docs/`. Why: Claude Code only auto-reads `CLAUDE.md` from the root, and `PRD.md` declares itself a root file. Alternative: keep them in `docs/` and symlink — rejected as fragile. Reverse: move them back and fix the cross-references.
- **D-0b** · pre-L1 · `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `docs/PHASE-0-CHECKLIST.md` **restored** after being deleted. Why: PRD L2 cites `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §4a for the per-migration run notes and §4b for the Stripe gates A/B/C, and L15 builds `LAUNCH.md` from it; `PHASE-0-CHECKLIST.md` is cited by `SETUP.md` §6. Deleting them would have left L2 without its runbook. Reverse: delete again once `LAUNCH.md` supersedes them at L15.
- **D-0c** · pre-L1 · The superseded PRD v2.1, the v2.1 task briefs and `BUILD-STATUS.md` moved to `docs/archive/` with a README, rather than deleted. Why: code comments cite v2.0/v2.1 section numbers and §17.6's map is easier to trust with the source to hand. Reverse: `rm -r docs/archive`.
- **D-0d** · pre-L1 · `.claude/settings.json` created from `SETUP.md` §5. Why: without it the run stops for a permission prompt on every command, which defeats unattended operation. Alternative: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — rejected, the allow-list is the safer default. Reverse: delete the file.

## Stage logs

Each stage gets: **Plan** (a checklist written before coding) · **Work** (items ticked with commit hashes) · **Evidence** (trimmed real output for each acceptance criterion) · **Notes**.

### L1 — Reconcile and guardrails
**Plan:** _(write before starting)_
**Evidence:** _(pending — the gate output under *Baseline* is the pre-L1 reading, not L1's acceptance evidence)_
**Notes:** the documentation half of L1 is already done (D-0a–D-0d). What remains: the branch, the trust-claim gate, `.env.example`, the two guards (`scripts/assert-dev-db.ts`, the non-production outbound guard), `npm run check:launch-inputs`, Next 16 deprecation warnings, and the README links.
